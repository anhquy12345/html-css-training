        A paragraph consists one or more sentences
        that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
        start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.

        Text is easier to understand when it is split up into 
        units of text. For example, a book may have chapters.
        Chapters can have subheading. Under each heading there 
        will be one more paragraph.
